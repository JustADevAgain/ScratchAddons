# Settings Page

This directory is built, but has already been compiled. It only needs to be recompiled when making changes.

## IDE Setup

We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) and [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) extensions. Vetur should be disabled if it's installed.

## Project Setup

With NodeJS and NPM setup install the dependencies with

```sh
npm install
```

## Building

To start a watcher for development that will automatically recompile when necessary:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Customize configuration

See the [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
