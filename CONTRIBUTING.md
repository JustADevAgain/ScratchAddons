# Contributing guidelines

For anyone who knows JavaScript basics: feel free to contribute to this repository! Our code is open source. Be sure to follow our [code of conduct](https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Filing [issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues)

Found a bug? Report it in an issue! But first, be sure to check if it was already reported by using the search bar [here](https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/issues). If there are no similar issues, you can create a new one. We will take a look at it.

Also, feel free to ask questions, suggest new features, and more.

## Creating [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

Contributions are welcome! If you have something in mind, it's best if you file an issue first (see above). That way, we can discuss it before you start a pull request. If you know a fix for that issue (or any other issue), you can follow the steps below to create a pull request.

If you're making a new addon, our [FAQ page](https://scratchaddons.com/docs/develop/getting-started/creating-an-addon/) will teach you how to make one.

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository if you haven't already.
2. [Sync your fork's `master` branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) to ensure it is up to date.
3. [Clone Scratch Addons](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository) so you can make and test your changes.
4. [Create a new branch](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/main/README.md#create-a-branch) from the `master` branch.
5. [Create, commit, and push](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#making-and-pushing-changes) the changes you want to make. Make sure you're committing to your new branch.
6. Go to the website and enable workflows in Actions on your fork so we can automatically clean up your code if necessary.
7. Finally, [create a pull request](https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/compare) on the origin repository (ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons). We will review your changes and talk about any further improvements if necessary.

If you don't want to use Git, [there are other ways to make changes, too.](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git#using-git)
