# Contributing guidelines

For anyone who knows [Git](https://git-scm.com) and JavaScript basics: feel free to contribute to this repository! Our code is open source. Be sure to follow our [code of conduct](https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Filing [issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues)

Found a bug? Report it in an issue! But first, be sure to check if it was already reported by using the search bar [here](https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/issues). If there are no similar issues, you can create a new one. We will take a look at it.

Also, feel free to ask questions, suggest new features, and more.

## Creating [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

Contributions are welcome! If you have something in mind, it's best if you file an issue first (see above). That way, we can discuss it before you start a pull request. If you know a fix for that issue (or any other issue), you can follow these steps to create a pull request:
1. [Fork](https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/fork) this repository if you haven't already.
2. [Sync your fork's `master` branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) to ensure it is up to date.
3. [Create a new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) from the `master` branch.
4. Make your changes and test them locally on a modified [download of Scratch Addons](https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
5. Commit and [push](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository) the changes to the new branch.
6. Finally, [create a pull request](https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/compare) on the origin repository (ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons). We will review and discuss your changes.

Information on making addons is available on our [FAQ](https://scratchaddons.com/docs/develop/getting-started/creating-an-addon/).

Tip: Before you make any edits, enable workflows in Actions on your fork. That way, we can automatically clean up your code if necessary.
