### Changes

<!-- I've added a new option for the addon `clones` which make the monitor display just the icon and the clone nuumber, without the clones text. -->

### Reason for changes

<!-- Because RIMOPA (https://github.com/RIMOPA) requested it on discord (https://discord.com/channels/806602307750985799/826250884279173162/972687955011465227), and I support the idea, it's a small change, but very useful for small screens. -->

### Tests

<!-- I tested it on Chrome and on Waterfox (Firefox based) on this project: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/659873974/editor/, and it worked. -->
